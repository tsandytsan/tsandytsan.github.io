              <p><i>Citrus Hack is a UC Riverside's premier 24 or 36-hour collegiate-wide hackathon.</i> In the year of 2020, Citrus Hack transitioned to a purely online 24-hour event. The theme was exploring new horizons, inspired by the rising interest and curiosity of space travel (Tesla and Elon Musk was the year's trending topic). For the hackers, the theme was also broadly interpreted to push their projects to their limit and explore that horizon awaiting them.</p>
              <p>With the theme in mind, I wanted to approach the overall colors from the bottom up. Generally, when one thinks of space, the general color scheme is dark, with pockets of neon-esque brightness to represent the planets and stars. I wanted to challenge that impression with a light theme and alternatively emphasize the vastness of the universe through dimensions/layers. The marketing committee at the time had people with limited design background so the designs required an approach fit for all skill levels. I found the paper cut and neumorphism styles to fit this mold; as the team could both learn and develop the design fundamentals of shapes, layers, coloring. Paper cut was used for the main design to highlight the main design and style. Neumorphism's minimalist appeal embellished accent designs while maintaining the overall cohesive style.</p>

              <p><i>Cutie Hack is a 12-hour beginner-orientated hackathon for students at UC Riverside and high schoolers in the surrounding Riverside area. It is also the sister event for Citrus Hack. </i> For 2019, we went with an ocean theme to highlight concerns for the health of the marine ecosystem. The participants were encouraged to create projects relating to the theme while developing their programming fundamentals. </p>
              <p>For an ocean theme, blue is a clear colorway to represent water and its seemingly bottomless depths. For this event, we started with the cover photo and pulled elements from the graphic into the other designs. The cover photo itself featured the UC Riverside's bell tower, which is a signature representative of the school. Giving the surrounding fishes a light yellow accent became a repetitive element for the succeeding designs as well, allowing it to be easily distinguished as a theme.</p>

The projects for this event centered around the theme shaping the environments around them, whether it's a virtual or physical.</p>
              <p>The main focus of this theme was its monochromatic color scheme and contrasting shapes. I focused on a color scheme with off-white and faded black, with orange and navy blue as the accent colors. There is then a slight texture in certain colors to add dimensions in the design itself. In terms of contrast between shapes, there is both integration both 3D and 2D objects as well as shapes itself (i.e., sphere vs. a circle). </p>

              <p><i>Fall Training Conference is a three-day, two-night in-person event bringing members of Circle K International together from all across the California-Nevada-Hawaii District.</i> The theme for this year was safari. As I was working with a team with mixed media responsibilities, it was necessary to produce designs that were easy to incorporate into various mediums. There was also concern that the theme would be confused with a jungle or forest.</p>
              <p>Because of this, the warm colors and simplistic silhouette design became the signature elements of the theme. The event brochure, as well as the apparel, website, and promotional video integrated the yellow, orange, and red, which was pulled from the cover photo. The animal figures from the cover photo were also extracted and integrated into event-related documents and videos. The icon itself is stamped into the website and the ending segments for the video reels as an animated centerpiece. </p>
