              <p>Citrus Hack is a 36/24 hour hackathon made for students by students at UC Riverside. In the year of 2020, Citrus Hack transitioned to a purely online 24 hour event, The theme was exploring new horizons, inspired by the rising interest and curiousity of space travel. For the hackers, the theme was also broadly interpreted to push their projects to their limit and explore that horizon awaiting them. </p>
              <p>With the theme in mind, I wanted to approach the overall colors from the bottom up. Generally, when one thinks of space, the general color scheme is dark, with pockets of neon-esque brightness to represent the planets and stars. I wanted to challenge that impression with a light theme and alternatively emphasize the vastness of the universe through dimensions/layers. The marketing committee at the time had people with limited design background so the designs required an approach fit for all skill levels. I found the paper cut and neumorphism styles to fit this mold; as the team can both learn and develop the design fundamentals of shapes, layers, coloring. Paper cut was used for the main design to highlight the main design and style. Neumorphism's minimalist appeal embellished accent designs while maintaining the overall cohesive style.</p>
